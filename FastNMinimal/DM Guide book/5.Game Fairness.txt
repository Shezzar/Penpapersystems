Guideline #4 Game fairness
While guideline #3 is important, do make sure to convey the difference in strength from one
monster to another, you need to remember that they don't know you tweak each monster, so
if you have a monster that is super quick, maybe portray it by describing strong and fast feet
or in any other way you wish.
